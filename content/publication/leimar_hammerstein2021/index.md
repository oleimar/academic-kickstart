abstract: Based on a survey of 200 papers, Kay et al. argue that many modeling results on the evolution of helping are likely due to kin selection, although this was not acknowledged by the original authors. Our work on the evolution of indirect reciprocity is one of the papers surveyed and criticized. We agree with many of the conclusions by Kay et al., but we wish to point out that the evolutionary stability of the standing strategy, which we investigated, does not depend on relatedness between donors and recipients of help. We, in fact, showed this analytically. We argued that the evolutionary success of so-called image-scoring strategies, proposed by Nowak and Sigmund, depends on genetic drift in small populations, and thus potentially on relatedness, whereas the standing strategy is robust to those effects. We conclude that there are cases where modelers have discovered the evolution of helping without carefully considering whether help is predominantly directed toward relatives, but there are also thoroughly studied strategies for which helping is dependent on social relationships other than relatedness. The standing strategy is one such example.
