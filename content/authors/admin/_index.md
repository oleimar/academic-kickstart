I am active in the [Ethology division](https://www.su.se/zoologi/english/research/research-areas/ethology) of the [Department of Zoology](https://www.su.se/zoologi/english/) at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/). My research spans over a broad range, from evolutionary and game-theory modelling to animal behaviour experiments.
