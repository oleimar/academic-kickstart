### How can we achieve a productive collaboration between game-theory modellers and empiricists?

The aim of the pre-ISBE 2022 symposium is to bring together empiricists that study phenomena or issues that involve frequency dependence and game-theoretic modellers that are interested in how their theory can help to understand real-world phenomena.

**Time:** Start at 10:00 on Thursday 28 July 2022, end at 16:00 the same day

**Place:** Stockholm University, biology lecture hall P216 (see map). To get from the ISBE congress venue, or from one of the centrally located hotels, take the metro. For instance, from the main central metro station ("T-Centralen") to Stockholm University ("Universitetet"), take line 14 towards "MÃ¶rby Centrum" and get off at "Universitetet" (4 stops). See map for how to get from the metro station to the lecture hall (P216) for the symposium.

**Organisers:** Olof Leimar (<olof.leimar@zoologi.su.se>) and John McNamara (<john.mcnamara@bristol.ac.uk>)

### Examples of issues to discuss

**For modellers**
* Implement models for dealing with real-world phenomena
    * Implement relatively realistic mechanisms, inspired by animal psychology and neuroscience
    * Implement relatively realistic situations in terms of life histories, population processes, and ecological situations
    * Use individual-based evolutionary simulations, letting the component traits of the mechanisms evolve in the setting of life-history and ecology

**For empiricists**
* Identify important phenomena/issues to study
* Identify and explore aspects of crucial mechanisms (experiments)
* Identify and explore aspects of life history, population processes and ecology (field studies and field experiments)
* Test predictions, and also test assumptions, of game-theory models

## Tentative schedule

The meeting will deal with a number of topics, where each topic has a short introduction by one or two of the participants, followed by a discussion among the participants.

* 10:00 - 10:15 **Introduction**, Olof Leimar and John McNamara
* 10:15 - 11:00 **Markets and mechanisms**, Zegni Triki
* 11:00 - 11:45 **Game theory in social evolution**, Stu West
* 11:45 - 13:15 **Lunch**, a short walk to Stora Skuggan restaurant
* 13:15 - 14:00 **Personality variation**, Niels Dingemanse
* 14:00 - 14:45 **Reproductive decisions and parental care**, Peter Buston and Andras Kosztolanyi
* 14:45 - 15:30 **Social structure (social organisation and social dominance)**, Alex Jordan and Olof Leimar
* 15:30 - 16:00 **Any topic that participants want to discuss**
